## Report Analysis about Sustainability, Case Studies and Forecast.

* [Plastic to Plastic](https://github.com/nico2997/Impact-X-/blob/main/Plastic%20to%20Plastic/Plastic%20to%20Plastic.pdf): How we can reduces the plastic waste which have remained ages on the ocean and landfills?

* [China Electric Vehicles(EVs) Market](https://github.com/nico2997/Impact-X-/blob/main/China%20Electric%20Vehicle%20Market/EV%20in%20China%20Market.pdf): The growth of EVs industry in China, what are the incentives given by both government and private sector to succeed the future China EVs market?

* [China Wind Energy Market](https://github.com/nico2997/Impact-X-/blob/main/China%20Wind%20Energy%20Market/Wind%20Energy%20in%20China.pdf): How 2020 become a staggering year for China wind energy, what actually was the president and local governments plan to succeed the future China wind energy industry and achieve 2060 carbon neutrality?

* [China Low-Carbon Agriculture](https://github.com/nico2997/Impact-X-/blob/main/China%20Low-Carbon%20Agriculture/Low%20Carbon%20Agriculture.pdf): What actually is sustainable agriculture and its association with Low-Carbon agriculture - climate change, can the Chinese governments provide enough incentives and subsidies for local farmers in order to achieve the future sustainable agriculture?

* [China Coastal Decarbonisation](https://github.com/nico2997/Impact-X-/blob/main/China%20Coastal%20Decarbonisation/China%20Coastal%20Decarbonization.pdf): There are actually two-ways relationship between ocean and climate. The rise of climate change and carbon might alter the properties of the sea. What is the importance of Hainan as coastal province of China in term of mitigating these issues? and what the benefit after Hainan being declared as the pilot zone to achieve ecological civilization?

How does it help with our carbon emission problem and meeting the world 2050 carbon neutrality? Can Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture Storage (BECCS) as CCUS example be reliable and long-lasting in future?

* [Roadmap of future 1.5 and 2 degree scenarios](https://github.com/nico2997/Impact-X-/blob/main/Roadmap%20of%20Future%201.5%20and%202%20degree%20scenario/Roadmap%20to%20future%201.5%20and%202%20degree%20scenario.pdf): The global warming is real! With constant warming occurs every year, it is very concerning to humanity. To achieve the 2050 carbon neutrality, we have applied relentless efforts, but will they be enough to prevent further earth's warming? Is it possible for us to reach the 2 or even 1.5 degree in future? Let's see different roadmap from experts about this.
